# What's Inside ðŸ—ƒ
- Advanced Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Problem Statements 
- Techiques to solve problems
- Short Tricks

## Read the following steps before contributing.
### Algorithms

|                |Follow these steps                         	|
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|New Algorithm|`'Please see if the algorithm is already present'`|
| What to include |`"Your algorithm should be efficiently written with proper code / comments / time complexity / space complexity / link to gfg or any other documentation on top in code file"`            |
|Where to include         |`'please commit your algorithm in the correct folder'`|
| README | `"Please check whether your directory has a README file, if there is then edit your algorithm name with a link, otherwise create a new one "`

### Problem Statement 

|                |Follow these steps                         	|
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|New Problem Statement|`'Please see if the problem is present already? If it is do not commit your own '`|
| What to include |`"Your problem statement solution should be efficiently written with proper code / comments / time complexity / space complexity / link to problem statement in code file"`            |
|Where to include         |`please commit your problem solution in the correct folder or discuss` [here](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/discussions/7) `before committing for where to include`|
| README | `"Please check whether your directory has a README file, if there is then edit your algorithm name with a link, otherwise create a new one "`

### To add ```DATA Stuctures``` or programs using ```STL```, follow the same approach as  ```Algorithms```


## Why contribute?
- If you find any errors or bugs then please report them by creating an issue. 
- If you can provide a more efficient solution or implementation of the algorithm then make sure to contribute. 
- If you want to implement an algorithm, data structure etc.., which is not yet there, then you can open up a PR regarding the same.
 
## Want to contribute?
- Take a look at [`contributing guidelines`](Contribute.md) if you're interested in helping!
- Refer [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow).
